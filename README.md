Customize your Twitch viewer/streamer recap 2020

## What
This is purely a page to generate the "recap image" from Twitch's website, but allowing you to customize each field.

To clarify: It does **not** retrieve any statistics from Twitch. All it does is use their "image generator" with custom parameters.  
In theory you could achieve the same thing with Photoshop, but this was a fun weekend project. :)
